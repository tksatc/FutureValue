        We at TKS Financial created our Financial Calculator app to provide you with
        a quick, easy means of estimating the return of a simple investment.  You
        simply enter a monthly amount of money to invest, the annual interest rate
        of the instrument (savings account, money market account, CD, etc.), and
        the number of years you expect to invest.
        <br /><br />
        Please let us know if this app is helpful for you!  Future additions to this
        app, as well as possible new apps, depend on the feedback we receive.
